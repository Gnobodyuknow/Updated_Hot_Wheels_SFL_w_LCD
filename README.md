# Updated_Hot_Wheels_SFL_w_LCD
I have taken a sketch created by Mike Freda, you can find him on Youtube, and updated a few of the libraries to work with a LCD display with an I2C addon. 
As well as, replacing outdated or no longer available libraries.
I am having one issue with it and that is it, after loading the sketch to the arduino, goes into a constant testing mode 
and never allows the system to reset and then be run again
